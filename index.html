					<u><i><h2> <u>A Little About Me </u></h2></i></u>
				<p>- My name is Ahmed Ismail and I am 24 years old. I currently live in the west end of Toronto, in the Etobicoke area. I was born in Toronto and have lived in the city my for my entire life except for 3 years, in which I lived in Edmonton, Alberta. Although I have lived in Canada all my life, I have visited a few interesting places inluding Cairo, Egypt, and Athens, Greece.  </p>
				<br /> 
				<p>- I am a middle child. I have 2 brothers and 2 sisters. I have an older brother and sister, as well as a younger brother and sister. I currently live with my parents and my 2 younger siblings. Some things that I like to do with my brothers include playing video games or watch our favourite basketball team, the Toronto Raptors. </p> 
				<p>- On the subject of basketball, I am a huge fan of the sport and I am quite talented on the court as well. I have been a member of the school basketball teams all throughout high school as well as middle school. I played the shooting guard (SG) and small forward (SF) positions during my time playing for the Dixon Grove Dragons (of Dixon Grove Junior Middle School) and the Kipling Wildcats (of Kipling Collegiate Institute).</p> 
				<p>- Another one of my hobbies that I am very passionate about is video games. I love to play video games on the weekends and after a long day of work/class and I personally find it as a great way to relax, unwind and have fun. I play a wide variety of video games but my top two favorite video game categories would have to be simulation sports games such as the ever-popular NBA 2k series, developed by Visual Concept Studios and open-world, sandbox games like the Grand Theft Auto series, which is developed by Rockstar Games.</p>
				<p>- I am very interested and passionate about pursuing an IT career. I am currently a participant in the NPower Canada Software Development & Testing Program. At the moment we are doing our best to prepare for the upcoming MTA 98-361 Exam, shortly after which we will begin studying for the following certification, the ISTQB. Currently, I have been thinking of the kinds of tech roles that I can see myself in, and given my interest, I think the video game industry may be a good fit for me. I have been playing since I was an adolescent and it is very exciting to be able to pursue a career where I will be testing and possibly designing games similiar to the ones I used to enjoy playing. I have learned to appreciate video games more now, after discovering just how much hard work is put into the development and release of a single game.</p>
				<p>- I dont really know what to talk about so I am going to tell a short two-part story about something that cool that happened to me a long time ago when I was in middle school. Its the story of how I met one of my favourite NBA players, Vince Carter, twice (in the span of a couple of weeks). He was a very cool, humble, and down to earth person. </p>
				<p>- The first time that I met Vince, I was participating in a youth basketball camp with about 10 other boys, and my group and I visited the Air Canada Center for a basketball camp, where we got to meet some of the Raptors trainers and staff members. We had no idea, but Vince Carter ended up making a surprise appearance. He met us individually, signed autographs, played basketball with us, and gave us all tickets to an upcoming charity All-Star game. He then showed us special drills to perform and practice, taught us some cool tips and tricks he uses, and even gave us feedback on things he noticed from watching us. At one point, while watching me shoot the ball, he noticed a mistake with my follow-through,  and he pulled me to side for about 5 mins and showed me step-by-step, the proper mechanics of a jump shot. Then the two of us shot hoops for a little while before he gave me five and made his way to another kid who was shooting at another basketball hoop nearby. </p>
				<p>- The second time that I met Vince was actually about a week and a half later, in my neighborhood. I live in high-rise condominium on Dixon Road near Kipling Avenue. He was in the neighborhood at an event to officially cut the ribbon on the brand new basketball court that he had donated to our neighborhood. There were hundreds of people present, including the press/media, and I believe there is also YouTube footage of the event  The basketball court was very much needed because at the time, there just wasnâ€™t a lot recreational activities available in the area for kids. It is greatly appreciated because it gave a lot of kids somewhere to go and play, and hang out. There were lights installed so it was accessible even at night. There were even various events such as tournaments and barbeques held there. It became sort of like the nucleus of the neighborhood, as it is nested right in the center of 6 high rise condominium towers. </p>
